"""Grade a SuperTuxKart race-telemetry reconstruction. Pure stdlib, deterministic.

The video is a suite of races on different tracks. In every race the camera is a chase-cam
locked to a single **hero kart** (the same character throughout the suite) — STK's profile
camera follows the player kart, and the generator makes the hero the player. Only the hero's
telemetry is scored, so **every scored quantity is on screen the whole race**. The top-center
HUD powerup slot is masked, so pickups have no on-screen confirmation.

For each race the agent reports, for the hero, TWO scored off-HUD quantities:
- **`items_collected`** — powerup boxes the hero drove through (HUD indicator masked; count the
  drive-throughs).
- **`skid_time`** — total seconds the hero spent drifting, in VIDEO time. Drift shows as bright
  yellow sparks from BOTH rear wheels (distinct from straight driving); estimate the cumulative
  drift duration.
(`spinouts` — times the hero spun out, banana or bomb dizzy-stars — may be reported as context but
is NOT scored; see the DIMS note below for why.)

## Scoring — EXACT, not just rank

    each predicted race is matched to a GT race by an OPTIMAL (assignment-safe) bipartite matching
    on its reported time t — a prediction whose t is CONTAINED in a GT segment [t_start, t_end) is
    preferred (half-open, so a shared boundary belongs to the later race; the final race keeps its
    right end), else one within +/-15 s is eligible (see match_races). Then, per dimension d:
      score_d    = clamp(tau_d, 0, 1) * accuracy_d
      tau_d      = signed normalised Kendall correlation over the matched pairs that carry d (the
                   guess GATE: concordant-minus-discordant / pairs, so a constant/random answer -> ~0)
      accuracy_d = ( sum over matched pairs carrying d of max(0, 1 - |pred-gt| / tol) ) / N_GT_RACES,
                   tol = max(1, 0.30*gt)   -- the divisor is the TOTAL GT race count, so COVERAGE is
                   folded PER dimension: a GT race with no matched prediction, or a matched prediction
                   that omits field d (or gives a non-finite value), contributes 0 to dimension d.
    reward = max(0, sum_d w_d * score_d) / sum_d w_d      (over dims that vary in the GT)

Per-dimension coverage means an items-only answer earns its honest items credit while skid_time
scores 0 — and padding a dummy skid_time (or a non-finite one) can neither raise nor erase the other
field's credit. A partial answer still cannot reach 1.0 (a correct 2-of-12 answer scores ~2/12).

This scores the agent against STK's **full-precision** telemetry, not a coarse ranking of it.
Ranking alone is too forgiving: an agent that systematically under-counts (e.g. sees 8 of 20
powerups) still ranks the races roughly right and scores well; requiring the counts to be
*accurate* removes that free credit. The tau gate keeps it guess-proof — an ungated exact metric
was rejected in an earlier design because blind guessing scored 0.33; here blind guessing scores
~0.03, because a guess has no rank agreement to multiply the accuracy by.

Weights: items_collected 0.55, skid_time 0.45 (drift seconds, in VIDEO time). Two off-HUD quantities
that both defeat a strong agent (it undercounts pickups ~half and cannot time drift within 30%).
spinouts is NOT scored — the dizzy-stars spin-out is legible enough that a strong agent counts it
well, so it is not a valid difficulty lever; it stays as unscored context. A field with no spread in
the GT is renormalised out so the oracle still reaches 1.0.

Ground truth is baked verifier-side at /tests/ground_truth.json.

# defeat it: it undercounts pickups by ~half and cannot time drift to within 30%):

#    on-screen count), so pickups must be caught from the video.
#  * skid_time — total DRIFT SECONDS in VIDEO time (the GT is MEASURED on that clock: a patched STK
#    integrates the real skid state in wall-clock seconds, which is what the capture records, so
#    nothing is rescaled; see generator/README.md). Drift's tell is bright YELLOW sparks from

    Segment membership is HALF-OPEN, [t_start, t_end), except the final race (largest t_end) which is
    closed [t_start, t_end]. GT races are contiguous (each t_end == the next t_start), so a closed

    belong to the LATER segment, so a race reported at its own t_start is contained in its own segment
