# Task Spec Card

```yaml
task: agentic_vbench_understanding/kart-race-telemetry-ledger-s1

cognitive_level: understanding
# The camera is a chase-cam locked to one hero kart (tux) for the whole suite. For each of twelve
# races the agent reconstructs TWO off-HUD quantities for the hero — how many powerup boxes it drove
# through, and how many seconds it spent drifting — neither shown as a number, and the powerup HUD
# slot is masked. Accurate fine-grained counting + a duration over a ~56-min horizon. The ranking
# column and minimap are navigation aids (position/timing), never answers.

modalities_required:
  video: the hero, the track boxes, the drift sparks, ranking column and minimap are all visual.
  audio: not used.

question: For each race, reconstruct the HERO kart's powerup boxes collected and drift seconds — both off-HUD — anchored to when the race happens in the video.
output_schema: '{"races": [{"track": str, "t": number, "items_collected": int, "skid_time": number}]}'  # t = video seconds; spinouts/bananas/nitro/positions optional, UNSCORED

ground_truth:
  source: SuperTuxKart 1.5 profile mode (--profile-laps) result table; the AI drives every kart and
          STK prints exact per-kart telemetry (bonus_count, banana_count, explosion_count, skid_time,
          ...). The camera follows the hero because the generator makes it the player kart (--kart=tux
          --ai=<rest>), so the recorded run is its own ground truth AND the scored kart is on screen
          the whole race. skid_time is MEASURED on the video's clock by a patched STK (see SKID
          TIMEBASE below, generator/README.md and generator/stk-actual-skid.patch); it is not rescaled.
  tier: machine-truth
  verification: oracle solution.json = the hero's telemetry rows; judge.py scores it 1.0 through the
                harness path (solve.sh -> judge.py) on both scored quantities.

scorer:
  metric: "EXACT + TIME-ANCHORED. Each predicted race is matched to a GT race by an OPTIMAL
           (assignment-safe, min-cost max-cardinality) bipartite matching on its reported time t: a
           prediction whose t is CONTAINED in a GT segment [t_start,t_end) is preferred, else one
           within +/-15 s is eligible — a count-vector at the wrong video segment earns nothing.
           (Segments are half-open, so a shared boundary t_end==next t_start belongs to the later race
           — the final race keeps its right end; the matrix is bounded to O(n_gt^2) regardless of how
           many rows are submitted. Containment-first + optimal assignment means an exact answer
           reporting every race, whole or partial, at its permitted t_start scores correctly, where
           the old greedy/closed-interval pass stranded a race at 0.0111 / 0.0.) Per
           quantity q: score_q = clamp(tau_q,0,1) * accuracy_q, where accuracy_q = ( sum over matched
           pairs carrying q of max(0, 1 - |pred-gt| / max(1, 0.30*gt)) ) / TOTAL_GT_RACES and tau_q is
           the signed Kendall correlation (the guess gate). reward = sum_q w_q*score_q renormalised
           over quantities that vary in the GT. COVERAGE is folded PER dimension via that denominator:
           a GT race with no matched prediction, or a matched prediction that omits quantity q (or
           gives a non-finite value), contributes 0 to q only — so an items-only answer earns its
           honest items credit while skid scores 0, a dummy field cannot inflate, and a partial answer
           still cannot reach 1.0 (a correct 2-of-12 answer scores ~0.17) while the full oracle stays
           1.0. Malformed races (null/non-list) normalize to [] (score 0, no crash). Weights:
           items_collected 0.55, skid_time 0.45. Regression-tested in steps/solve/tests/test_coverage.py
           (22 checks)."
  # WHY exact, not rank. Rank agreement alone is too forgiving: an agent that systematically
  # UNDER-counts (Codex sees ~half the powerups) still ranks the races roughly right and scored ~0.35.
  # Scoring against STK's full-precision telemetry (within ~30% per race) removes that free credit.
  # The tau gate keeps it guess-proof: an ungated exact metric was rejected in an early design
  # (blind guessing 0.33), but multiplying by rank agreement drops blind guessing to ~0.02.
  # WHY only items + skid (spinouts dropped). n=3 calibration showed the dizzy-stars spin-out is
  # legible enough that a strong agent counts it well (accuracy up to 0.60), so scoring it broke the
  # <0.10 bar (2 of 3 Codex runs 0.10-0.19). The two quantities kept both genuinely defeat a strong
  # agent — it undercounts pickups ~half and cannot time drift to within 30%.

# SKID TIMEBASE (correctness). The agent times drift off the VIDEO, so the GT has to be on the
# video's clock. Two things separate STK's stock statistic from that clock, and both are now fixed at
# the source instead of by rescaling:
#   1. Stock skid_time counts the time the skid INPUT was held, not the time the kart actually
#      drifted; on this suite it runs 1.136x-1.378x above the real drift, per race.
#   2. Telemetry is in GAME seconds, and software-GL capture runs below realtime.
# The patched STK (generator/stk-actual-skid.patch) integrates the REAL skid state in WALL-CLOCK
# seconds, and x11grab records at a constant wall-clock rate, so the scored value is already in video
# seconds. Rescaling could not have produced it: per-race render factors run 1.128-1.927 while each
# race's own drift wall/game ratio runs 1.033-1.765, and the two disagree by as much as 0.241
# (cocoa_temple, 1.927 vs 1.686) -- a single factor mis-scales the quantity it is meant to fix.
# GT carries skid_actual_game, skid_input_game, skid_showgfx_game and render_speed_factor per race as
# unscored context, so the choice is auditable. Oracle = 1.0 on the measured values.

# OBSERVABILITY — both scored quantities are visible on the hero (crops in calibration/crops/):
#  * items_collected — the hero drives THROUGH a question-mark box (visible; HUD confirmation masked).
#  * skid_time (drift seconds) — drift has a DISTINCT tell: bright YELLOW sparks spray from BOTH rear
#    wheels while skidding (drift_720p.png / zoom_drift_sparks.png) and vanish the instant the kart
#    runs straight (zoom_no_drift_straight.png). Witnessable, and its duration scorable — HARD (time
#    + sum the drifts to within 30%). spinouts (banana/bomb dizzy-stars) is NOT scored: it is legible
#    enough to be countable by a strong agent, so it is not a difficulty lever; it stays as context.

difficulty: {strong_agent_reward: 0.0885, agent_model: gemini-3.5-flash}  # host-run (CV-tool profile); clean image pilot PENDING

# CALIBRATION STATUS -- VOID as of 2026-09-04. Every agent number below (and difficulty:

# reproducible run-to-run, so the current suite is a NEW instance and these do not transfer: they
# are kept only as the record of how the design was hardened. The gate-setting pilot has to be re-run
# on the current media before this task can merge. Scorer-only ablations (which need no agent) are
# re-measured against the current ground truth and are marked as such.
# The numbers below were HOST-RUN and INDICATIVE (Docker unavailable on our node;

#   + EXACT-count metric (accuracy within 30%, not rank): items term 0.46 -> 0.10
#   + time-anchored (races matched by video time +/-15 s)
#   + skid_time MEASURED in video seconds by a patched STK (timebase fix; replaced the rescale)
#   + DROP spinouts (too countable; broke the bar) -> items+skid
#   + scorer fixes (assignment-safe t_start matching; races=null -> 0; per-dimension coverage)

# FAIR + LEARNABLE: oracle = 1.0, blind-guess ~0.027; a within-30% agent scores far higher. Difficulty
# is ACCURATE pickup-counting under a masked HUD + a drift DURATION over a 55-min video, not a hack.

  contents: 12 races (hacienda, snowmountain, cornfield_crossing, lighthouse, gran_paradiso_island,
            sandtrack, olivermath, cocoa_temple, scotland, fortmagma, ravenbridge_mansion,
            stk_enterprise), 4 laps each, 10-kart fields on SuperTux (hardest) AI. The hero (tux) is
            in every race and the camera follows it throughout; the TOP-CENTER HUD powerup slot is
            MASKED (black box) so pickups must be caught from the hero driving through a box. The
            other nine karts race around it (contesting boxes, bombing it) for realism.

## Notes

- **Why it is a real reconstruction problem.** Neither scored quantity is displayed as a number.
  Recovering them means following the hero through every lap of every race and *accurately* measuring
  two independent things — powerup-box drive-throughs (HUD masked) and drift seconds — then reporting
  exact per-race values, not just an ordering. On SuperTux difficulty the hero genuinely fights for
  boxes and drifts hard corners.
- **Observability is the point.** The camera is locked to the hero and only the hero is scored, so
  every scored event is on screen by construction. `calibration/crops/` shows 720p frames of each
  scored tell (incl. the yellow drift sparks).
- **Exact scoring, guess-gated.** Accuracy (within ~30% of the machine value) forces real counting
  and timing; the tau gate zeroes a guesser. The oracle scores exactly 1.0.

## Fairness constraints enforced during generation

- **The hero is always present and always the camera target.** run_race.sh passes
  `--kart=<hero> --ai=<rest>`; build_ground_truth.py asserts the hero is in every race and that both
  scored fields vary, or it refuses to emit a degenerate ground truth.
- **The field stays legible.** parse_profile.py asserts the parsed field size and rejects duplicate
  kart ids (STK backfills unknown `--ai` ids with a duplicate), so every kart is a distinct visible
  character.

## Known limitations

- **skid_time is measured on the video's clock, not rescaled onto it.** The rescaling this bullet
  used to describe is gone: a patched STK integrates the drift directly in the render's own frame
  time, so there is no whole-race average factor and no residual within-race error from one. See
  SKID TIMEBASE above.
- **spinouts is not scored.** The dizzy-stars spin-out is legible enough that a strong agent counts it
  well (n=3: accuracy up to 0.60), so scoring it broke the <0.10 bar; it is kept as unscored context.
- Each race is TIME-ANCHORED: the GT tags every race with its video window and the agent must report
  each race's video time t, matched within +/-15 s (correct counts at the wrong segment score ~0 —
  see scorer, correct_counts_wrong_times 0.0). Per-EVENT ordering *within* a race (each pickup
  timestamped) would need machine-exact per-event times, which STK's prebuilt binary does not expose
  headless; per-race aggregates at per-race timestamps are the ceiling.
