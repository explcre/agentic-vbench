"""Assemble a hero-scoped race suite into the verifier ground truth.

    build_ground_truth.py SUITE_DIR ground_truth.json

SUITE_DIR holds race0/, race1/, ... each produced by run_race.sh: a per-race `gt.json`
(the full parsed profile table) and a `hero.txt` naming the camera-followed kart.

Only the HERO kart's counts are exported per race. The camera is a chase-cam locked to the
hero the entire race (run_race.sh passes `--kart=HERO`), so every scored quantity is on
screen by construction — this is the "scope the counts to what the camera sees" fix. The
rest of the field still races and is visible in the video, it is just not what is counted.

The final GT ranks races by the hero's counts (see judge.py), so what is stored per race is
the hero's row plus the track name and race order.
