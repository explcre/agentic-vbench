# Record an AUTHENTIC Minecraft session: the real 1.20.4 client renders the world while the same
# mineflayer bot that drives the headless path plays in it, with the client locked to the bot's
# point of view by /spectate. Nothing is composited — cracks, hurt flashes, hand swing, particles
# and sound are the game's own.
#
#   authentic_session.sh OUTDIR [PHASES]
#
# Why this shape (each point cost a failed attempt):
#   * 1.20.4, not 1.16.5 — `--server` never auto-connected in 1.16.5; quickPlay arrived in 1.20.
#   * options.txt with onboardAccessibility:false — the 1.20 first-launch accessibility screen
#     blocks quickPlay, and it was the reason the client sat on a four-button dialog.
#   * JDK 21 from $HOME — 1.20 needs Java 17+, this host only has 8 and 11.
#   * NO_VIEWER=1 — the bot's own prismarine-viewer is pointless here and just burns CPU.
#   * the port is checked before launch, because a stale server silently ate an earlier run.
#   * the Camera is NEVER op'd and chat is hidden. Paper broadcasts "Builder issued server command:
#     /setblock ... minecraft:oak_planks" to every op, so an op'd camera prints the exact ground
#     truth on screen -- a total answer leak in the graded footage.
#   * the Camera is put in spectator the instant it joins, and the world spawn is forced to open
#     ground. It previously spent ~4 s in survival inside solid stone at the default spawn,
#     suffocated, and the whole recording was the death screen; `/spectate` then failed with
#     "Attempt to teleport removed player Camera restricted" because a dead player cannot be
#     teleported. The old script printed SPECTATE_LOCKED unconditionally and never noticed.
#   * ops.json is written BEFORE the server starts. A fresh Paper server has `ops: []`, and an
#     unprivileged player gets *"Unknown command"* for /setblock, /summon and /locate -- Brigadier
#     hides commands you may not run. That looks exactly like a version incompatibility and cost a
#     whole session (0 events recorded) before `probe_1204.js` isolated it.

# Lock the camera to the bot, and CONFIRM it from the server's own complaint stream.

# Two things make this awkward and both were learned the hard way. (1) For a few seconds after
# "Camera joined the game" the player entity is still 'removed' server-side, and /spectate answers
# "Attempt to teleport removed player Camera restricted" -- so a single early attempt silently does
# nothing. (2) A spectator is NOT transmitted to other clients as an entity, so a Director bot can
# never see the camera's position; confirming the follow by comparing coordinates is impossible, and
# an earlier watcher that tried spun until it gave up. Since sendCommandFeedback/logAdminCommands are
# off (they leaked the ledger into chat), there is no success message either.
#
# What IS observable is the failure: mark the log, issue the commands, and read only the new bytes.
# No complaint after the final attempt means it took.
