Scoring is order-based (see the task's judge.py), so no video-timestamp recovery is needed —
the bot's own event order *is* the ground truth. This script also runs the judge against
three deliberately wrong submissions and prints the scores, so a regression in the verifier
is visible immediately:

  oracle    exact ledger                      -> must be 1.0
  shuffled  right multiset, wrong order        -> should be low
  mono      the single most common token, xN   -> should be low
  mine_only actions right, all targets 'stone' -> should be low
